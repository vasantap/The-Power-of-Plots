# The Power of Plots 
#### What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?






## Description
In this project, the data of Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals is used. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
We have been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
We have been tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. We were also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
## Observations and Insights
1. Looking at the mean and median values of the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane, we can say that they worked better in reduction of mouse tumor volume.
2. The 249 mice population identified with SCC tumor growth had only a slightly higher percentage of male at 50.96% to female at 49.04%. So, the likelihood of a tumor based on the sex is almost the same. 
3. Any tumor values below 25.36 and above 87.67 can be considered outliers. In the given sample, only two mice with Mouse ID k403 and s185 were found to be outliers.
4. The correlation coefficient between weight and average tumor volume is 0.84, showing that they have a positive correlation.
